This is the latest improvement 
on our algorithm - It does not
stop until it has explored every
single node that it can see. It
is blazingly fast - it makes the
decision to explore closeby nodes
over going the long range to explore
nodes to the center. The rational is
that exploring nodes that we are
immediately next to is very useful 
since they could help us find a 
faster path - even one that is
at an edge. By weighing all nodes
like this, the algo hardly wastes
any time in solving the maze - 
using a move for every tile, and 
then some extra for travelling
along already visited tiles to 
explore new ones. 

The maze times are as follows:


	12	14	16
base:	655	822	NA
algo2:	509	641	858
algo3: 	374	487	648
algo4:	185	232	305
