This is the best algo we have so far
when it comes to discovering the maze
in the fastest time. It improves on 
algo_v2 by taking jumps when it can. 
This prevents it from using up a lot
of time travelling between far nodes. 
In fact, it cut down around 200 steps
on the 16x16 maze. This is saving us
around 7 whole points!! Not to mention
that this also saves us a lot of time
when getting to the center of our maze. 

The maze times are as follows: 

	12	14	16
base:	655	822	NA
algo2:	509	641	858
algo3: 	374	487	648
