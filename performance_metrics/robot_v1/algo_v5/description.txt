I forgot to allow the robot to move
backwards - it now doesn't have to
waste a move doing 180 degree turns. 
This is very useful and shaves off 
a fair bit of time, around 1 point
for the runs. There was a concern
that the robot could get trapped in 
a dead end - but this isn't possible. 
If the robot backed into a dead end, 
that tile was connected to the graph
of reachable nodes. This is only 
possible if the robot saw into the 
dead end in the first place. 

The maze times are as follows:


	12	14	16
base:	655	822	NA
algo2:	509	641	858
algo3: 	374	487	648
algo4:	185	232	305
algo5: 	168 	216 	284
