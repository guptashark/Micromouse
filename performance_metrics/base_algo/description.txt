This data is useful because we can plot it to see how well 
our robot is discovering the maze. It is just numbers right now, 
but here are the key points we're running with: 
	- Find an unexplored tile with the least distance.
	- Plot a route to that tile. 
	- If at any point, we discover a better tile, update the route. 

The issues we're running across are: 
	-The robot may zig zag through the maze: 
		-near tile A, it sees a tile around 12 steps away (tile B)
		-it visits B, expending 12 steps, or more
		-it then sees a tile right next to A
		-it then visits the tile next to A, again expending 12 steps
		-The knowledge gain seems to be quite minimal for effort. 

	-The robot only takes one step at a time. 
		-The robot only ever takes one step at a time. 
		-smarter decision making will help it skip over tiles
			that is has already discovered on the route
			instead of stopping at every tile.
