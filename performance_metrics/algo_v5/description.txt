I forgot to allow the robot to move
backwards - it now doesn't have to
waste a move doing 180 degree turns. 
This is very useful and shaves off 
a fair bit of time, around 1 point
for the runs. 

The maze times are as follows:


	12	14	16
base:	655	822	NA
algo2:	509	641	858
algo3: 	374	487	648
algo4:	185	232	305
algo5: 	168 	216 	284
